## 1. Business Understanding
Via the Hypothesis testing, we can evaluate which feature has a better performance.

## 2. Data Understanding 
The Diabetes dataset was loaded via Colab. The dataset is from Kaggle: kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergylog/ab-test-aggregated-data
 (also please see ab_test_results_aggregated_views_clicks_2.csv attached). 

* Data Dictionary
  
| Name | Measurement Level| Description |
| ----  | ---------------- | ---------- |
| **user_id**  | int | user unique id |
| **group**  | obj | experiment group |
| **views** | int | number of webpage views |
| **clicks** | int | number of experimental feature clicks |
 
## 3. Data Preparation 
1. check missing data
2. create click-through rate (CTR)
  
## 4. Statistical testing    
Now we will run A/B testing for CTR.
For A/B testing to be applied, the data set must satisfy the Normality and Variance homogeneity assumptions.
If normality and variance homogeneity is provided, an independent two-sample t-test (parametric test) is applied.
If normality and homogeneity of variance are not provided, the Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric test) is performed. How to check the assumption of normality? In this, we will first determine the H0 and H1 hypotheses.

1. Shapiro-Wilk test
- H0: The assumption of normality is provided.
- H1: The assumption of normality is not provided. Now let's check the assumption of normality.

2. Mann-Whitney U test
- H0: There is no significant difference between the two groups in terms of click rate to the desired page.
- H1: There is a difference.

## 5. Evaluation
1. The Shapiro-Wilk Test suggests the data set does not follow the Normality and Variance homogeneity assumptions.
2. The Mann-Whitney U test suggests CTR is a difference between the control and test groups. 
3. While the average conversion rate was 3.46% in the Control group, this rate increased to 3.86% in the Test group. 
As a result of our tests, we can say that this rate increase is not accidental, but has been proven statistically.
